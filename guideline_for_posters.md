# Guideline for Posters

## Prepare Your Poster

In general, posters are created using vector graphics rather than bitmaps. For layout and figures, [Microsoft PowerPoint](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/powerpoint) and [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) are recommended. Lance's poster template can be downloaded via [this link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JNL2pBfhLe5WAYbaQJA16yDYIUjEBEmu/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102324655763258449245&rtpof=true&sd=true). The followings are some examples made with this template:

## Print Your Poster

There are some less expensive options (around NTD 1,000) for printing a (72x36 inches) posters near NTHU.

Ensure your poster is saved in the `.pdf` format. The staff will assist in resizing your poster to fit their printing formats (e.g., A1, A2). Typically, the poster can be completed within three days. Personally, I prefer 震華 over 玖偵, since 玖偵's color is inconsistent and impure (i.e., Fig. (b)).
